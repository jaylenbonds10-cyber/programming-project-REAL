# AI Job Impact Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes how Artificial Intelligence is affecting jobs
across various fields, focusing on how quickly or slowly different types
of jobs are being automated. Our goal is to provide clear insights into
which professions are at risk, which remain secure, and the factors
influencing these trends.

## What We Cover

1.  **General Information**\
    We begin with an overview of the topic and highlight initial
    observations about AI's influence on the job market.

2.  **Jobs by Education Level**\
    We analyze how AI impacts jobs across different levels of
    educational requirements.

3.  **Salaries of Jobs Affected by AI**\
    We compare the salaries of positions that are more likely to be
    automated.

4.  **Jobs With the Lowest Predicted Risk**\
    We identify roles that are the least likely to be replaced by AI in
    the near future.

5.  **Jobs Most and Least Likely to Be Taken by AI Before 2030**\
    Finally, we compare high‑risk and low‑risk occupations and discuss
    why certain jobs are more vulnerable.

## Key Findings

Our research shows that many jobs requiring minimal physical movement or
repetitive digital tasks are at the highest risk of automation.
Creative, hands‑on, and highly interpersonal roles remain comparatively
safe---for now.
